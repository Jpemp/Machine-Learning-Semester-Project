The project's datasets are too big to be placed in the GitHub repository.

To get the train and test dataset for this project. Go to this link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kritanjalijain/amazon-reviews/data
Download the **train.csv** and **test.csv** files from the link. Add the items in the same solution as the **MachineLearningSemesterProject.py**
_(Assuming you are using Visual Studio to compile and run the code, go to the Soltuion Explorer window that the Python code is in, right-click project item, go to Add, then click Existing Item, and select the csv files)._
Once the datasets have been loaded into the solution, the project can run properly.
