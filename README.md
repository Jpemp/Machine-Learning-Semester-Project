The purpose of this project is to create a sentiment analysis classification model from Amazon reviews. The sentiment has a polarity of 0-1, with 0 being a negative sentiment and 1 being a positive sentiment. 

The datasets this project is based on are too big to be placed in the GitHub repository.

To get the train and test dataset for this project. Go to this link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kritanjalijain/amazon-reviews/data

Download the **train.csv** and **test.csv** files from the link. Add the items in the same solution as the **MachineLearningSemesterProject.py**
_(assuming you are using Visual Studio to compile and run the code, go to the Soltuion Explorer window that the Python code is in, right-click project item, go to Add, then click Existing Item, and select the csv files)._

Once the datasets have been loaded into the solution, the project can run properly.

Graphs and charts will pop up to display the data of the classification model. This will temporarily pause the program from running. To continue the program, close the chart that pops up, and the program will resume its execution.
